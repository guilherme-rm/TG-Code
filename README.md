# Bachelor Thesis (TG) - Guilherme Reis Miguel

This repository stores the code that was written for my Bachelor thesis at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA, Brazil). In this work I studied Time Evolving Graphs, using both classical as well as Artificial Inteligence models for Time Series forecasting and graph analysis

## Time Series 

The Time Series folder contains notebooks for time series analysis using differnent techniques. "ARIMA.ipynb" uses ARIMA models. This notebook describes how I analysed the data to choose the model, how it was used to do the forecasting and presents some performance evaluations.
